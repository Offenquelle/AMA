# Overview
This repository contains the code that was used for our presentation in Advanced Managerial Accounting at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg. We conducted a study whether earnings quality is associated with higher firm value, as proxied by Tobin's Q. 

# How to run the code
To run the entire R script, proceed as follows: 
1. Install any required package in "Data Transformation.R" under "Load Packages & Data Set"
2. Set a working directory and make sure that the scripts and the data sample "Sample_V3.xlsx" is contained in that directory
3. Load "Data Transformation.R" in RStudio, mark the code and run.
4. Once it runs, it will automatically run the other scripts.
